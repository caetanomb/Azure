1. Be mindful of the default values you use. Make sure that it'll be safe for someone to deploy the Bicep file with the default values. For example, consider using inexpensive pricing tiers and SKUs so that someone deploying the template to a test environment doesn't incur a large cost unnecessarily.
2. Use object parameter for specifying resources tags
3. The uniqueString() function is useful for creating globally unique resource names. It returns a string that's the same on every deployment to the same resource group, but different when you deploy to different resource groups or subscriptions.
